        <img src="images/headShot.jpg" alt="I found a decent looking picture of myself, so here it is!">
        <p>I am a software developer who has always loved using algorithms and data structures to improve both my work environment, and that of my colleagues.</p>

        <img src="images/momJonEphesus2.jpg" alt="Image for 'how did I get here?' (my mother is in this picture.)">
        <p>In my past and present positions - whether as a team member, team leader, or outside advisor - I made extensive use of computer technology and pattern analysis to increase efficiency, profits, and even team communication. Over the years I found that I was most absorbed in my job when I had the opportunity to program my computer to do things such as convert data or make calculations based on conditions I gave it - so much so that I became the go-to person when colleagues needed their spreadsheets debugged! The next logical step was to dive into that state of mind and make it my full-time job.</p>

        <h2>Do I have other interests?</h2>
        <img src="images/kitties.jpg" alt="A striped cat and grey tuxedo cat">
        <p>Of course! I love cats, with a particular affinity for rescue cats who have stripes or grey tuxedos. I ride my bicycle on a daily basis, and I also like to hike, ice skate, and ski. Recently I've gotten into gardening, and am proud to have kept most of my flowers, herbs, and other plants alive - despite squirrels eating my Sun Gold tomatoes! I'm always up for watching Star Trek, especially while eating a good piece of cheese and drinking some strong loose leaf tea, preferably with a striped cat and grey tuxedo cat by my side.</p>
