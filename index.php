    <h2>Why do I write code?</h2>
    <p>I am a software developer who has always loved using algorithms and data structures to improve both my work environment, and that of my colleagues.</p>
    
    <h2>How did I get here?</h2>
    <p>In my past and present positions - whether as a team member, team leader, or outside advisor - I made extensive use of computer technology and pattern analysis to increase efficiency, profits, and even team communication. Over the years I found that I was most absorbed in my job when I had the opportunity to program my computer to do things such as convert data or make calculations based on conditions I gave it - so much so that I became the go-to person when colleagues needed their spreadsheets debugged! The next logical step was to dive into that state of mind and make it my full-time job.</p>
    
    <h2>What technologies do I use?</h2>
    <!-- JavaScript, PHP, Linux, MySQL, Jquery, HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, ActiveRecord, SQLite3, Git, GitHub, Heroku, SASS -->
    <ul>

    <h3>Do I have other interests?</h3>
    <p>Of course! I love cats, with a particular affinity for rescue cats that have stripes or grey tuxedos. I ride my bicycle on a daily basis, and also like to hike, ice skate, and ski. Recently I've gotten into gardening, and am proud to have kept most of my flowers, herbs, and other plants alive. (but squirrels ate my Sun Gold tomatoes) I'm always up for watching Star Trek, especially while eating a good peice of cheese and drinking some strong loose leaf tea, preferably with a striped and grey tuxedo cat at my side.</p>
